## Hey, I am Moiyyad ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by. I'm an MS Data Science student at the University of Iowa, Spring 25. I work on Web-GIS systems and am currently writing a research paper [_Coming soon_]

I have worked as a Salesforce Consultant, helping Sales, Manufacturing and Financial Service set up and optimize their tech and data management systems.
